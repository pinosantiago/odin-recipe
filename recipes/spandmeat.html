    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The classical Italian dish. No more to add.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 good-quality pork sausages</li>
        <li>1 kg beef mince</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ a large bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>85g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten with a fork</li>
        <li>olive oil, for roasting</li>
        <li>spaghetti, to serve (about 100g per portion)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the meatball sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>4 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>125ml red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>½ a large bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>few basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First, make the meatballs. Split the skins of the sausages and squeeze out the meat into a large mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the mince, onion, parsley, parmesan, breadcrumbs, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well – the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, allowing about five per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin – the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep warm while you cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling, salted water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a few basil leaves, if you like.
        </li>
    </ol>
