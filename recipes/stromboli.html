    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Stromboli is a bit like a large, rolled-up pizza and is usually served warm or at room temperature in thick slices as a hearty alternative to a sandwich. The dish is thought to have been invented in the mid-20th century by Italian-Americans in Philadelphia in the US. The dish is named after the 1950 film Stromboli, which is in turn was inspired by a volcanic island near Sicily.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>400g strong white flour plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>5g fast-action dried yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>20 slices Milano salami (about 100g)</li>
        <li>150g grated mozzarella</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Tip the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and 1 tsp salt. Pour in 250ml warm water and the olive oil, and bring together with a wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Tip onto a surface and knead for 10 mins until smooth. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel and set aside for 40 mins or until doubled in size.

            Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle roughly 35 x 20cm. Layer over the salami (leaving a bit of a border), then scatter over the mozzarella and finally the basil leaves. Tuck the shorter edges in and roll the whole thing up like a swiss roll. Will keep frozen, tightly wrapped in foil, for up to one month. Can either be defrosted and baked, or baked from frozen (see step 3).

            Leave the loaf to rest for 20 mins on a baking tray. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C/180C/gas 6. Brush all over with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake for 40 mins until puffed up and golden. If cooking from frozen, bake for 1 hr. Leave to cool for 10 mins before slicing and serving with salad.
